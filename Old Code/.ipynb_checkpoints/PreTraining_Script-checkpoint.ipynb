    "# Preprocessing DMSP and Black Marble Data for Super-Resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is the first step in preparing nighttime satellite imagery for super-resolution enhancement using the R-ESRGAN model. Specifically, it focuses on data from the **Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)** and **NASA's Black Marble product**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nighttime lights data from satellites like DMSP have been widely used in research to study urbanization, economic development, population density, and conflict. However, the DMSP dataset is limited by its **low spatial resolution** and various artifacts like cloud cover, sensor noise, and saturation in bright city centers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these limitations, this project enhances DMSP images using a super-resolution model—**R-ESRGAN (Real-Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network)**—which requires training on paired low- and high-resolution images. DMSP data provides the low-resolution input, while NASA’s **Black Marble** dataset (which offers higher-resolution visible light imagery) serves as the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What This Notebook Does\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download DMSP Nighttime Lights data** for selected dates and regions.\n",
    "2. **Download matching Black Marble images** for the same times and locations.\n",
    "3. **Organize the data into folders** for easy access during training.\n",
    "4. **Patch the raster files** into smaller, uniform tiles for efficient model training.\n",
    "5. **Prepare the data for fine-tuning** a super-resolution model (R-ESRGAN).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step will be implemented and explained clearly, with emphasis on reproducibility and practical understanding. The goal is to build a robust dataset that can help \"teach\" the R-ESRGAN model how to sharpen and restore low-resolution DMSP imagery using realistic high-resolution examples from Black Marble.\n",

    "\n",
    "This script automates the process of downloading Black Marble nighttime light data for a list of countries and aligns it with existing DMSP data. The key steps are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loop Through Countries**: For each country in `countries_of_interest`, the script identifies all valid DMSP image dates from previously processed files.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Download Black Marble**: For each DMSP date, it runs the `Downloader.py` script using the same start and end date to fetch the corresponding VIIRS Black Marble data. Output is saved in a central `test_bm_download` folder.\n",

    "3. **Rename Julian Dates**: Since Black Marble files are saved with Julian dates (e.g., `Qatar_2013222.tif`), the script converts these to standard `YYYYMMDD` format (e.g., `Qatar_20130811.tif`) for consistency and pairing.\n",
